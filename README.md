# Index Revisions and Stock Returns

We are currently working on an analysis of the explanationsâ€”price pressure, downward-sloping demand curves, improved liquidity, improved operating performance, 
and increased investor awareness for the increase in stock value associated with new inclusions in the DAX30 Index.

## The database

We collected all stocks that were listed in DAX at some point after 2010 (https://www.dax-indices.com/document/Resources/Guides/Historical_Index_Compositions_20.12.2021.pdf). The data was retrieved from Reuters for 50 stocks incl. the DAX itself between Januarst 1st 2008 and March 1st 2022.
